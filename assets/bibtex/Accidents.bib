abstract = {Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Relational Data Mining (RDM) address the task of inducing models or patterns from multi-relational data. One of the established approaches to RDM is propositionalization, characterized by transforming a relational database into a single-table representation. This paper presents a propositionalization technique called wordification which can be seen as a transformation of a relational database into a corpus of text documents. Wordification constructs simple, easy to understand features, acting as words in the transformed Bag-Of-Words representation. This paper presents the wordification methodology, together with an experimental comparison of several propositionalization approaches on seven relational datasets. The main advantages of the approach are: simple implementation, accuracy comparable to competitive methods, and greater scalability, as it performs several times faster on all experimental databases. Furthermore, the wordification methodology and the evaluation procedure are implemented as executable workflows in the web-based data mining platform ClowdFlows. The implemented workflows include also several other ILP and RDM algorithms, as well as the utility components that were added to the platform to enable access to these techniques to a wider research audience.},
