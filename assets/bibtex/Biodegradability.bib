abstract = {This paper is concerned with the use of AI techniques in ecology. More specifically, we present a novel application of inductive logic programming (ILP) in the area of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). The activity we want to predict is the biodegradability of chemical compounds in water. In particular, the target variable is the half-life for aerobic aqueous biodegradation. Structural descriptions of chemicals in terms of atoms and {\#} The work described in this paper was conducted while the author was at the University of Freiburg, Machine Learning Lab.
