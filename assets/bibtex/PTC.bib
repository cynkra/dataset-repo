abstract = {Summary: We initiated the Predictive Toxicology Challenge (PTC) to stimulate the development of advanced SAR techniques for predictive toxicology models. The goal of this challenge is to predict the rodent carcinogenicity of new compounds based on the experimental results of the US National Toxicology Program (NTP). Submissions will be evaluated on quantitative and qualitative scales to select the most predictive models and those with the highest toxicological relevance.Availability: http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ ml/ptc/Contact: helma@informatik.uni-freiburg.de},
